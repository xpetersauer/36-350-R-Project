cat("Dear Aliens, \n
    Hello! How are you? Hope your Summer is going well :) \n
    On Earth, we have different seasons (cycles of different environments).\n
    We refer to Summer as the 'hot environment' on the upper hemisphere of Earth \n
    (or the part closer to the north pole). Now that I think about it though, Earth's \n
    axis might be completely screwed so that 2021's North is actually screwed. \n
    Anywho, I hope you are friendly to humans. Someone of us are not cool, but some of \n
    us are! I hope your civilization isn't trying to conquer us. War is bad! \n
    As a welcoming offer, I will type out one of our most valuable pieces of music, \n
    the American National Anthem. On behalf of Earth, we welcome you with open arms! \n

    Y'all don't really know my mental \n
    Lemme give you the picture like stencil \n
    Falling out, in a drought \n
    No flow, rain wasn't pouring down (pouring down) \n
    See, that pain was all around \n
    See, my mode was kinda lounged \n
    Didn't know which-which way to turn \n
    Flow was cool but I still felt burnt \n
    Energy up, you can feel my surge \n
    I'ma relieve everything like this purge (ayy) \n
    Let's just get this straight for a second, I'ma work \n
    Even if I don't get paid for progression, I'ma get it (get it) \n
    Everything that I do is electric \n
    I'ma keep it in a motion, keep it moving like kinetic, ayy (yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah) \n

    Can you please read between the lines? \n
    My rhyme's inclined to break your spine \n
    They say that I'm so fine \n
    You could never match my grind \n
    Please do not, not waste my time \n
